This is Jill and I created this repo and markdown document. 

COLLABORATOR (AnnaClaire):

```{r}

library(tidyverse)

kermit <- read_csv("kermit.csv")


kermit_hist <- ggplot(kermit, aes(x = Score.pre)) +
  geom_histogram() +
  facet_wrap(~Gender)

kermit_hist

```

Creator (Jill): doing some rank-based tests

```{r}

# Is there a significant difference in pre-talk Kermit scores for males and females?

# Unpaired: Mann-Whitney U

mwu_kermit <- kermit %>% 
  wilcox.test(Score.pre ~ Gender, data = .) 

mwu_kermit

# there is no significant difference in pre-talk Kermit scores for males and females 

```
